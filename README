This package has two example models to use.  The file DuluthSDTSDEM.tar.gz is an example of a tarballed USGS SDTS data set.  The .ddf files contained in DuluthHeightsSDTS are the untarred format of an SDTS data set.  Normally you get a lot more than just the four, but those are the only four needed to run jdemview.  Also in DuluthHeightsSDTS are the topographic and orthographic maps for Duluth Heights.  To execute the program, change to the dist folder and run 
#java -jar jdemview.jar

Additional options are:
#java -jar jdemview.jar filename	// should be the full path to the file.
